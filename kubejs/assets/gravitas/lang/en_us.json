Hydration levels may change slightly due to climate but remain in the same estimated area. The levels go down the farther away from a source you are. They also go in as squares around the water. The first square around the source will have the most hydration from 100%-91%. The next square will be from 90%-71%. After that 70%-51%.

Keep notice of the climate before starting a farm to know what you can plant.",
	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.compost": "Plants don't NEED nutrients, but it definitley will help. The more Nutrients the faster the plant will grow and the more crops it gives when harvested. All plants have a favorite Nutrient which can be checked in the TFC Guidebook. The most common plant helper is Compost. Compost can be made in a (TFC) Composter.

	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.windmill": "If you want a working greenhouse you'll need a working pump station. To get a working Pump Station you'll need Mechanical Power. To get Mechanical Power you can use a Windmill. Attach Windmill blades to an axle and Boom windmill! They can hold up to 5 windmill sails on one system. More blades equal more power.",
	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.waterwheel": "Another way of getting Mechanical Power is a Water Wheel. For it to work it needs to be in moving water from TFC, like a river. How much of the Water Wheel is submerged changes the power. No, the different wood types don't change anything besides color and recipe.",
	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.axle": "Axles are the easiest way of moving Mechanical Power around.

To get started you need: Pumping Station, Irrigation Tank, source of Mechanical Power, and Copper Pipes to move the water. 1. Place the Pumping Station above a nonmoving source water. 2. Place up to three Irrigation Tanks on top of it. 3. On the Pumping Station find the hole bigger than the others, and connect the moving axles to it. 4. Put Copper Pipes attached to any of the other holes on the Pumping Station. You won't know if it's actually working until the whole Greenhouse is ready though.",
	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.sprinkler": "Unless you want to constantly water your plants in your greenhouse you'll need a Sprinkler. Sprinklers can water a 5x5x6 area above or below based on how they're placed. To get them sprinkling they need to be 1. Attached to previous structure mentioned via Copper Pipes. 2. In a valid Greenhouse. To get the Copper Pipes into the Greenhouse you'll need a Greenhouse Port.",

No copper and wood Greenhouses. You can use any of the Greenhouse block types as long as it has walls and a ceiling. It can not be exposed to outside air besides an door in the open position.

	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.planters": "Farmland doesn't work in Greenhouses so instead you'll need Planters. They work just like Farmland but selective to only Greenhouses. The different Planters do different things. Large Planter and Quad Planter grow normal crops. HydroPlanter grows ones that need to be planted in water. Bonsai Planter does small Fruit Trees and Trellis Planter does Berry Bushes. The Hanging Planters grow plants upside down.",
	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.climate_station": "The Climate Station is how you get the Greenhouse working. Once your Greenhouse is created place down the Climate Station on floor level next to the walls. When the Climate Station is showing Ice that means there's a problem. If it's showing Water then it's good! Right click and it'll tell you if the Greenhouse is working. Then when its working use ports to get sprinklers and place down your planters and right click the Climate Station again. The Sprinkler should say valid greenhouse same with the planters. If it's all working the Sprinklers should be sprinkling, the planters should be getting water, and you should feel great success in your heart.",

	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.stop": "These Tracks are made for stopping the Locomotives and Carts. The Locking Kit stops carts and only starts them when given a redstone pulse. The Buffer Kit is for the end of your tracks, will stop them and not start. The Gated Kit just deploys a Fence Gate connected with the track.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.move": "These Tracks Kits are for changing momentum with your carts. The Transition Kits change the speed of the passing Locomotive, needs redstone power. The Booster Kits will speed up the cart if powered and slow down the cart if not powered. The Control Kit gives the carts a little push, when powered it'll change the direction it pushes it in. The Throttle Kit will change the speed of a passing Locomotive to whatever speed is configured, needs to be powered with redstone. The Launcher Kit will quite literally throw your cart!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.entities": "These Track Kits are for using entities with your carts (Entities like mobs). The Embarking Kit will pick up any mobs nearby and put them in a cart. The Disembarking Kit unloads mobs from the carts. The Dumping Kit will drop the mobs in the carts below the tracks its on.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.redstone": "These 2 Track Kits are for using Carts and Redstone. The Activator Kit will activate whatever cart goes over it. The Detector Kit will activate a redstone signal whenever a cart passes over it. Both are similar to their vanilla counters for regular tracks.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.coupler": "The Coupler is for connecting or disconnecting carts. Coupling is the phrase for connecting Carts. It can be configured with a Crowbar to couple, decouple, or auto couple. Needs Redstone to work.",

	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.crowbars": "The Crowbar is the main tool of RailCraft. When used on a Locomotive it will change the direction it's facing. When shift clicked you can connect Locomotives and Carts. When just used on carts they give them a slight push. And when used on special tracks they change their mode.",

	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.wye": "The Wye Track is the second track made by using a Spike Maul. It directs two tracks into one. If you have one track intersected by another the Wye will move carts on the first track into the intersecting one.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.junction": "The Junction is the last track made by the Spike Maul. It acts as a normal intersection for tracks. Carts keep going the same way as before but now tracks can intersect. What happens if 2 carts hit each other on it? THEY EXPLODE!!! I'm kidding but Electric Locomotives will though.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.track_switch": "The Switch Track will be needed for moving lanes between the different Special Tracks. The Arrows on it show which goes where.",

	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.electric_locomotive": "Unlike the Steam Locomotive you won't need to put anything into the Electric Locomotive. It runs off the power from the Frames beneath the Electric Tracks. Yes, it can only be runned off Electric Tracks.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.bore_head": "To actually use a Tunnel Bore you'll need a Tunnel Bore Head. They come in 4 different styles and it mines dependent on the Bore Head. It can be enchanted and has durability so you'll want to enchant it!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.tunnel_bore": "The Tunnel Bore is perfect for automatically placing rails especially under mountains or hills. It'll need 3 things to start working: Bore Head, fuel like Coal, and Rails. Once it has all 3 just let it go! Careful as cave collaspings can still happen with the Tunnel Bore.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.minecart": "Minecart!!!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.new_carts": "These new carts are similar to the special vanilla carts. Obviously the Track with a workbench gives you a movable crafting table. The Jukebox Cart gives you a movable Jukebox. And the Tank Cart gives you a movable storage for liquids.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.carts_and_tracks": "These new carts are mostly for laying down tracks. The Track Layer places down Tracks while the Track Remover removes Tracks. The Track Relayer replaces the tracks with different ones and the Track UnderCutter replaces the blocks beneath the tracks.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.item_loader": "The Item Loader is the most basic dispenser from RailCraft. It has to be above the track and can be configured to what you'll want loaded onto your carts below. ",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.advanced_item_loader": "The Advanced Item Loader is everything the regular one is but can be used from anywhere near the track. Next to, above, next to on the other side. Use the Crowbar to change its direction.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.item_unloader": "The Item Unloader is the opposite of the Item Loader. It will take items from the carts. This one must also be above the track.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.advanced_item_unloader": "The Advanced Item Unloader is just like the normal part but can be used from any direction. Nothing different besides direction.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.fluid_loader": "The Fluid Loader will be helpful to keeping your Steam Locomotives up and running. It has to be placed a few blocks above the tracks and it will deploy fluids into either the Locomotive or carts.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.fluid_unloader": "The Fluid Unloader is the exact opposite of the Fluid Loader. Instead of being over the track its under. Instead of giving Steam Locomotives water it takes their water. I don't know why you'd want to do that but you can!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.cart_dispenser": "The Cart Dispenser will do as the name suggests. It can dispense any carts onto the tracks in front of it. Needs a Redstone signal to dispense.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.train_dispenser": "The Train Dispenser is a better version of the Cart Dispenser. It can Dispense the whole Locomotive and more! Set a pattern for what you want to be deployed then give it a redstone signal.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.machines": "RailCraft uses many machines for different things but mostly for resource creation.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.steel": "Railcraft has it's own smelter to make Steel but its disabled in this modpack, you'll have to use the GregTech Primitive Blast Furnace to get steel now!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.coke": "Like with making Steel Railcrafts Coke Oven is disabled. You'll need to use the GregTech Coke Oven to get Coke and Creosote.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.making_steam": "The Water Boilers are some of the most helpful machines from RailCraft. They need a Fuel Firebox and some sort of boiler on top. The Fueled Firebox can be 1x1 2x2 or 3x3. The size of the Firebox changes how big the Boiler on top can be. For 1x1 Firebox it can only have 1x1 Boiler. For 2x2 Firebox it can be a 2x2x3 Boiler. For 3x3 Firebox it can be 3x3x4. The Liquid Fuel will take Lava or Creosote to heat up. For Solid Firebox it'll use anything a furnace can use.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.steam_energy": "The Steam Turbine uses Steam to make FE and EU energy. It's 3x2x2 building of only Steam Turbine Housing, it'll need a Turbine Motor in it, and Steam piped in.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.steam_furnace": "The Steam Oven is another machine that uses Steam for something useful. By putting Steam into the Steam Oven it will act as a furnace to any items in it. Making Ingots from Ores and cooking food items. It's a 2x2x2 machine of Steam Oven blocks.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.water_tank": "The Water Tank is like having a barrel outside. Just this barrel is much bigger. It collects water and can hold water for Steam Locomotives. The amount of water is makes is dependent on the biome and visible to the sky. It's made by a 3x3x3 Water Tank blocks with the center being hollow.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.crusher": "The Crusher is just as the name suggests. It can crush blocks to get the crafting materials, like bricks from a brick staircase, or dusts from ingots. It needs power to work though! To build one it's 3x2x2 of Crusher blocks.",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.manual_roller": "The Manual Rolling Machine will be your little crafting machine for many things material for railcraft! When you put the recipe in and it can make more than 1 it will autocraft while you're still looking at it. When you leave the Rolling Machine while crafting it will abort the crafting and put it in your inventory. You must manually build the last recipe!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.powered_roller": "The Powered Rolling Machine is much better version of the Manual Rolling Machine. You don't have to keep looking in the machine to craft things and it will automatically craft all of them. The only problem is it needs power!",
	"gravitas.quest.railcraft.desc.iron_tank":"While GregTech drums and Create copper tanks provide compact storage, they fall short when it comes to scalability and capacity. Railcraft Iron Tanks, on the other hand, take fluid storage to an industrial level.\n\nA 3x4x3 can store 576 buckets of fluid, which should be plenty for all of your early game needs.",

The most basic is just placing items on the ground. By using V (default keybind can be changed) you can place items on the ground. It only stacks items 1 at a time and the amount is dependent on weight and size of items. Items placed like this will not despawn but can be burnt or broken.",
