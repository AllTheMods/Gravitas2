    "gravitas.quest.caveman.desc.beehive": "The Beehive is where you store the Frames. You can store 4 frames in 1 beehive. The more frames in 1 beehive the higher the chance for a Queen to move in. This can also be increased by placing flowers in a 5 block radius of the beehive.",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.automate_create.1": "Now that you've made some basic Create machines, you can automate things. One good thing to automate is Raw Iron Blooms to Wrought Iron ingots.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.automate_create.2": "You can automate this using presses, belt, funnels and depots. It might be difficult getting the speed right, until you have a better funnel.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.press": "Have you noticed that some items need a plate rather than a sheet? Well, for that you'll need a mechanical press. Oh, and a depot, this thing won't work without a depot under it.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.iron_plate": "Use that mechanical press to make an Iron plate. Not sure how to set it up? Hover over the mechanical press in your inventory and hold 'w' to ponder the machinery. Isn't create great?",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.fan.1": "The next step after Create is Immersive Engineering, but before we get there we'll need some Aluminium. To make Aluminium you'll need to crush some Cryolite with an Engineer's Hammer to get the Grit, then blast it with a fan and some lava.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.fan.2": "Wait, we can't move lava yet. &6Damn, guess that might have to wait! Unless you can make a quick blasting setup at a volcano...",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.funnel": "Speaking of a better funnel. For this, you'll need an electron tube. There's two options here, one of them makes more than the other, but you'll need to do some Immersive Engineering for that.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper_making.1": "You'll need some paper to really get into Immersive Engineering, you can't make blueprints without paper. You also can't make books without paper, and having the IE manual is real useful.",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.1": "If you're lucky enough to find papyrus in the wild, or trade with a villager for it, then you can make paper by following a few steps.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.2": "First, take one piece of papyrus and combine it with a knife. Next, you'll want to soak those strips in water for about 8 hours. Take those soaked papyrus strips and weave 'em on a loom. Lastly, like with Leather, put that unrefined paper on a log and scrape it to obtain your paper.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.saw.1": "You can use a saw to increase the output of your logs, and as a bonus you'll get sawdust which has a multitude of uses.",

	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.waterwheel": "Another way of getting Mechanical Power is a Water Wheel. For it to work it needs to be in moving water from TFC, like a river.

Place up to three Irrigation Tanks on top of it. 3. On the Pumping Station find the hole bigger than the others, and connect the moving axles to it. 4.

	"gravitas.quest.farm.desc.sprinkler": "Unless you want to constantly water your plants in your greenhouse you'll need a Sprinkler. Sprinklers can water a 5x5x6 area above or below based on how they're placed. To get them sprinkling they need to be 1. Attached to previous structure mentioned via Copper Pipes. 2.

Then when its working use ports to get sprinklers and place down your planters and right click the Climate Station again. The Sprinkler should say valid greenhouse same with the planters.

You have to right click a track with the Coupler to set it then place it down in block form next to it. Depending on where the green line is facing is where the other Coupler will be placed. You have to use a Wrench to change where the second Coupler will be. By rightclicking the base of the Coupler you can change its mode. When powered by redstone it will activate dependent on it's config.",

The actual block can be placed farther up the track than the tripping device. When your train goes over the tripping device the Signal will emit a redstone signal. This can be used for many other devices in stopping trains.",
	"gravitas.quest.rails.desc.nixie_tube": "The Nixie Tubes have many uses but for trains they work well with the Train Signal. When put above a Train Signal and its activated the Nixie tubes will light up. Similar to the lights by railroad crossings. The Semaphore is a much more physical train stopper. When you put one with a Train Signal it will move the Semaphore arm into the way of the train. It won't stop the train, but it'll be hard for the Conductor to miss it.",

They have 2 main uses, redstone and trains. You can attach a lead to them and click the lead onto the seat of your train and they'll drive it. For redstone they'll activate closest redstone device when looked at. Helpful for automatically switching lanes.",

The Fueled Firebox can be 1x1 2x2 or 3x3. The size of the Firebox changes how big the Boiler on top can be. For 1x1 Firebox it can only have 1x1 Boiler. For 2x2 Firebox it can be a 2x2x3 Boiler. For 3x3 Firebox it can be 3x3x4. The Liquid Fuel will take Lava or Creosote to heat up. For Solid Firebox it'll use anything a furnace can use.",

The amount of water is makes is dependent on the biome and visible to the sky. It's made by a 3x3x3 Water Tank blocks with the center being hollow.",

The most basic is just placing items on the ground. By using V (default keybind can be changed) you can place items on the ground. It only stacks items 1 at a time and the amount is dependent on weight and size of items. Items placed like this will not despawn but can be burnt or broken.",
