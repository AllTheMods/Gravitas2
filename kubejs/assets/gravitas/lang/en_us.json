    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.fan.1": "The next step after Create is Immersive Engineering, but before we get there we'll need some Aluminium. To make Aluminium you'll need to crush some Cryolite with an Engineer's Hammer to get the Grit, then blast it with a fan and some lava.",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.funnel": "Speaking of a better funnel. For this, you'll need an electron tube. There's two options here, one of them makes more than the other, but you'll need to do some Immersive Engineering for that.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper_making.1": "You'll need some paper to really get into Immersive Engineering, you can't make blueprints without paper. You also can't make books without paper, and having the IE manual is real useful.",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.1": "If you're lucky enough to find papyrus in the wild, or trade with a villager for it, then you can make paper by following a few steps.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.2": "First, take one piece of papyrus and combine it with a knife. Next, you'll want to soak those strips in water for about 8 hours. Take those soaked papyrus strips and weave 'em on a loom. Lastly, like with Leather, put that unrefined paper on a log and scrape it to obtain your paper.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.saw.1": "You can use a saw to increase the output of your logs, and as a bonus you'll get sawdust which has a multitude of uses.",
