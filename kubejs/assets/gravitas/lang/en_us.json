    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.press": "Have you noticed that some items need a plate rather than a sheet? Well, for that you'll need a mechanical press. Oh, and a depot, this thing won't work without a depot under it.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.iron_plate": "Use that mechanical press to make an Iron plate. Not sure how to set it up? Hover over the mechanical press in your inventory and hold 'w' to ponder the machinery. Isn't create great?",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.rolling": "The Rolling Mill makes making rods and wire a lot less hammery by taking the hammer and anvil out of the equation.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.fan.1": "The next step after Create is Immersive Engineering, but before we get there we'll need some Aluminium. To make Aluminium you'll need to crush some Cryolite with an Engineer's Hammer to get the Grit, then blast it with a fan and some lava.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.fan.2": "Wait, we can't move lava yet. &6Damn, guess that might have to wait! Unless you can make a quick blasting setup at a volcano...",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.funnel": "Speaking of a better funnel. For this, you'll need an electron tube. There's two options here, one of them makes more than the other, but you'll need to do some Immersive Engineering for that.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper_making.1": "You'll need some paper to really get into Immersive Engineering, you can't make blueprints without paper. You also can't make books without paper, and having the IE manual is real useful.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper_making.2": "There's a couple of ways to make paper, either find some papyrus, or make a saw and use sawdust.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.1": "If you're lucky enough to find papyrus in the wild, or trade with a villager for it, then you can make paper by following a few steps.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.2": "First, take one piece of papyrus and combine it with a knife. Next, you'll want to soak those strips in water for about 8 hours. Take those soaked papyrus strips and weave 'em on a loom. Lastly, like with Leather, put that unrefined paper on a log and scrape it to obtain your paper.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.saw.1": "You can use a saw to increase the output of your logs, and as a bonus you'll get sawdust which has a multitude of uses.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.saw.2": "If you combine 4 sawdust with a bucket of water, you'll get two paper. You can also make... not much else currently...",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper": "Now that you have paper, you can make things like books, and blueprints, and... uhh... sandpaper? Clipboards? Maps? There's lots you can do with paper, I'm sure of it.",


    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.weak_blue": "Weak blue steel is made by alloying &3Bismuth Bronze, Black Steel, Sterling Silver, Steel.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.weak_red": "Weak red Steel is made by alloying &3Black Steel, Brass, Rose Gold and Steel.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.bucket": "This is the main goal of progressing through TFC. This will allow you to start moving the creosote around to make treated wood.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.obsidian": "Using a red or blue steel pickaxe you can mine obsidian to make a nether portal.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.going_deeper": "Using some spare steel and a flint you can make a flint and steel or you can use a firestarter.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.high_blue": "combining the Weak Blue steel with Black Steel and Flux in an anvil will allow you to make High Carbon Blue Steel.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.high_red": "Combining Weak Red Steel with Black Steel and Flux will create High Carbon Red Steel.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.red_bucket": "This bucket can be used to move source blocks of water. Now you can pick up and move water.",
    "gravitas.quest.blacksteel.desc.blue_bucket": "This bucket can be used to move lava. It's the only way to move lava, so if you want lava at your base, make this bucket.",


    "gravitas.quest.moon.desc.silicon_press": "Search around on the Moon for the Presses. It will also be worth picking up a bunch of skystone while getting the presses.",
    "gravitas.quest.moon.desc.fluix_crystal": "Fluix Crystals are formed by dropping &3Nether Quartz, &3Redstone and &3Charged Certus Crystals &finto water."
