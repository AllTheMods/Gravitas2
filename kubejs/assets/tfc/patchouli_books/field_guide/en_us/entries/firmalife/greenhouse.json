The Greenhouse has an array of types and blocks to choose from. However, building a greenhouse is quite simple. Like the $(l:tfc:firmalife/cellar)Cellar$(), it should be an enclosed area of blocks belonging to the same $(thing)Greenhouse Type$(). The floor of the greenhouse may be non-air block."

Panel walls should be placed so that the face that is on the exterior of the block (eg. the face you can place a torch on) faces into the greenhouse. The same applies for roofs, except that slabs are always considered valid roof blocks. Trapdoors and doors are also always valid and require no special placement."
